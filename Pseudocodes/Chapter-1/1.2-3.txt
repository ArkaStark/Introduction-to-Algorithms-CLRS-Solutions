For what smallest value of n will an algorithm with t(100n^2) run faster than an algorithm with t(2^n)?	

   100n^2 < 2^n	
=> log(100n^2) < log(2^n)	
=> log(100)+2*log(n) < n.log(2)	
=> 2(1+log(n)) < 0.301*n	

 Solving this inequality gives us the smallest value of n is 15 for the condition to be true. 	

 Ans=> n=15.
